# Tensorflow.js w/ Electron

This repository contains several Tensorflow.js examples bundled as an Electron app.

## Getting Started

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/brangerbriz/tf-electron
cd tf-electron

# install dependencies
npm install

# run the electron app
npm start
```
You should now see an Electron window pop up with a list of several examples. Several of these examples are taken from [tfjs-examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples) and modified slightly to work with Node.js/Electron out-of-the-box. I've also annotated the source code so that it is more readable for beginners.
